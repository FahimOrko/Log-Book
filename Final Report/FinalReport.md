## 4. Feedback

> This course introduced me to a new area of technology within cybersecurity and significantly expanded my technical understanding. I learned how to identify and handle common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and authentication flaws, which aligns well with my focus on full-stack development. The course improved my awareness of how to secure web applications and APIs during development. It also increased my interest in cybersecurity as a field, and my next goal is to further explore ethical hacking and defensive security practices.
